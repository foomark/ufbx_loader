# ufbx_loader
FBX model loader with skinned mesh animation support using UFBX C library sample.

The sample program uses OpenGL to display the model on screen.

Note, the version of OpenGL uses the legacy fixed-function pipeline, as well as GLUT to handle the window management cross platforms. 
It contains no shader code in order to simplify the illustration of how to use UFBX.
